The current implementation of the project is based on HTML and Bootstrap CSS.This website is mobile and different device fully responsive. This is now a static website but by the time I will make this website dynamic ny using react. There is a variety of functionalities which can triggered by clicking on an icon or seraching for a specific field in the original website. These all actions/functionalities can be done using react.
